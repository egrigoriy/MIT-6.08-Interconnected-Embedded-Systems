## Lab1A: Final Assignment

Your final system that you and your partner make should operate in the following way:

1. Starts displaying one word or image on the LCD (your choice. Feel free to experiment).
2. When the user presses the button (on the press) it starts displaying another image (again your choice, but it needs to be significantly different...like maybe a triangle, you pick, you're the artist).
3. When the user presses (on the press) the button again it goes back to displaying the first image.
4. The system can continue to toggle between these two images based on button presses forever.

The state diagram looks like the following:
